TutorMe is a free, open-source tutoring service meant to bring together seekers of knowledge.

Standardized education approaches are antiquated and ineffective. They should be brought up to speed. TutorMe believes knowledge belongs to the world, and seeks to make it available to everyone, everywhere. Sometimes we all need a little extra help understanding things; getting that help shouldn't be expensive, inaccessible, or difficult. This is the role of TutorMe. We bring educators with a passion for their subject matter together and provide a platform for them to share that knowledge with those who are seeking it.
